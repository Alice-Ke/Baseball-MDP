This is the code & data folder for ELEN 6001 advanced project.

* Project: Explore Batting Strategies using Markov Decision Process
* Author: Pu Ke
* Columbia Unit: pk2532

===================================================================

The folders & files in this folder can be categorized into 4 types:

1. Data folders:
	all the folders named with year+eve
	(the play-by-play baseball data from 1991 - 2017 is download from 
	http://www.retrosheet.org)

2. Log files:
	diff27pitcher.txt: policies produced for each year & each pitcher
	diff27evaluation.txt: evaluation produced for each train/test pair
	reverseRL.txt: reward function tuning process

3. Code: ( ordered from the low to high )
	 process.py: data cleaning and preprocessing
	 bellman.py: value-iteration and policy-evaluation algorithm 
	 	implementations 
	 stats.py: the basic mathematical and statistical functions used 
	 	in the main file calc.py
	 calc.py: top-level file
	 ( Running it may take some time, since it's iterating the 
	 parameters for reward functions, and also calculating probability 
	 matrix, value-iteration, policy-evaluation for all the data points ) 

	 type "python3 calc.py" to run the top-level file, while there is
	 also some testing code writen in each module.

4. Pickle files:
	generalProb.p: store the general transition probabilities for each year
	pitcherProb.p: store the pitcher-specific transition probabilites
		for each pitcher in each year

	The pickle files are just used to save time when calculating the 
	probabilites. If you want to see the actual calculation process 
	from the begining, you can comment the lines:

		pitcherProb = pickle.load( open( "pitcherProb.p", "rb" ) )
		generalProb = pickle.load( open( "generalProb.p", "rb" ) )

	and uncomment the lines:

		for year in totalYears:
	    	prooduceGeneralStats(year)

	inside the calc.py
